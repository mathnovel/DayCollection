# Disciplined Convex Programming
This website is designed to teach disciplined convex programming (DCP). DCP is a system for constructing mathematical expressions with known curvature from a given library of base functions. DCP is used by the [convex optimization](http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) modeling languages [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/), [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/), [Convex.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl), and [CVXR](https://cvxr.rbind.io/) to ensure that the specified optimization problems are convex.

After reading about the [DCP rules](https://dcp.stanford.edu/rules), visit the [DCP Quiz](https://dcp.stanford.edu/quiz) to test your understanding, or type expressions into the [DCP Analyzer](https://dcp.stanford.edu/analyzer).
